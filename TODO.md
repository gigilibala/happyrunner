## TODO

- Add support for iOS:

  - Font icon material [here](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)
  - React native paper [here](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/docs/guides/getting-started)

* What we need in active workout screen

  - Heartrate -> current, lap, total
  - Distance -> total, lap
  - Cadence -> current, lap, total
  - Pace -> current, lap, total
  - Elevation -> current (maybe gained or lost)
  - Time -> total, lap

* Units of measure
  - Elevation: Meters vs Feet
  - Heartrate: BPM
  - Cadence: Steps per minute
  - Distance: Miles or kilometers
  - Pace: Minute/Mile or Minute/Kilometer
